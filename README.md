### About Me ###
- I am a second-year Statistics student at the Univeristy of Toronto, where I am specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- I have a strong interest in software development and I enjoy creating applications that solve real-world problems. In one of my recent projects I developed an <a href="https://github.com/Shak789/DecisionMate" target="_blank">Android Application</a> which helps first-year Computer Science students at the Univeristy of Toronto Scarborough verify if they have qualified for a Program of Study.
