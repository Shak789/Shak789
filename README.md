### About Me ###
I am entering my third-year as a Statistics student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I am pursuing a [Specialist in Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/specialist-program-statistics-science), alongside a [Major in Mathematics](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/major-program-mathematics-science). I am actively seeking Co-op opportunities in data analytics, data science, or machine learning for Fall 2024.

I have a strong passion for statistical analysis and Machine Learning, and my current interests lie in sports analytics. I recently conducted [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380347690_Analysis_of_NHL_Goalscoring_in_Critical_Situations) on the performance of NHL players in close and tied games, and I developed a classification system to discern their goalscoring in critical game scenarios.

## What I'm Currently Learning ##
I am currently expanding my knowledge of deep learning by exploring PyTorch and TensorFlow.
