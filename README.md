### About Me ###
- I am a second-year Statistics student at the Univeristy of Toronto, where I am specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- I have a strong interest in software developmen. My goal is to leverage my programming and problem-solving skills to create applications that solve real-world problems. I recently created an <a href="https://github.com/Shak789/DecisionMate" target="_blank">Android Application</a> for first-year Computer and Mathematical Sciences students at the Univeristy of Toronto Scarborough to determine if they have qualified for a Program of Study.
- Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a passion for teaching students mathematics. I developed a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/shakeel-jivraj/" target="_blank">two-part mathematics course on Udemy</a>, an online learning platform. The course aims to teach students pre-algebra concepts and refine their skills through practice questions
- During my free time, you can find me working out and catching up on the latest hockey news.
